        <div class="Blog__title">Why I hate social media</div>
        <p>Hello, yes, this is the second day of daily blogging, glad I made it this far lol. </p>
        <p>I just go back from school and figured I better write now before I start wasting my time doing useless shit like watching youtube.</p>
        <p>There is one thing that always happen when I sit down and want to write something, and that is when I try to think of something to talk about, suddenly nothing comes to mind, but when I just start typing random stuff, next thing I know is I've written 500 words down.</p>
        <p>I love <a href="https://markmanson.net/how-to-get-better" target="_blank">writing</a>, just as much as I love reading. okey, I like reading more, I'd say reading is the best habit I ever had, I'll forever be glad that I started reading at a young age (18, maybe not so young). But, nowadays, with social media and a million youtube video to watch, reading doesn't seem so appealing, cause it takes time. and I don't think many people read, just pick a book and sit somewhere in your school and see how people will look at you, your friends will probably joke about it and make fun of you for having a book or  even thinking about buying one. Meanwhile, if you are taking pics of food at a restaurant and posting that on IG, that's normal. Oh yeah, fuck those people who do this.</p>
        <p>Why the hell would you take a pic of your food and post it online? "Oh look at me I have money to go to a restaurant". suppose I'm on phone swiping between stories and I see your food pic, what value did that add to my life? <strong>NOTHING.</strong> </p>
        <p>Speaking of <a href="https://markmanson.net/attention-diet" target="_blank">social media</a>. I hate watching vlogs. I think it's a waste of time. (PS. I do watch some also.). why? because I believe that if you have the time to watch other people living their lives, you  really need to re-consider your life decisions. you probably have a shitty life.</p>
        <p>It just doesn't make any sense. If you had an interesting life, you wouldn't have time to watch other people living theirs. </p>
        <p>One of the reasons I love writing is it feels like you're having a conversation with yourself. and I like to give myself advice, remind myself of stuff, or simply just think about stuff through journaling.</p>
        <p>I've written a lot. that's enough for today, it doesn't matter what I wrote, I will eventually get better at it, and then I'll write big essays about useful stuff, now I just write about whatever in my mind, just to keep the habit going, to get better at least <a href="https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement" target="_blank">1% a day</a>.</p>
        <p>See you tomorrow.</p>

        <div class="Blog__title">Hello, this is my first blog post</div>
        <p>well, this is my very first blog ever, actually it's not, I have already written some blog posts before but I deleted them. But now, I'm serious. I will make this a habit, no more procrastinating on publishing my stuff online, who's gonna read it anyway? </p>
        <p>just me lol.</p>
        <p>Actually the reason I've finally decided to do this, is a very short article I read today by Seth Godin titled "<a href="https://seths.blog/2020/12/the-most-important-blog-post/" target="_blank" >The most important blog post.</a>". </p>
        <p>I had a habit of journaling for the past few months, I'll try to post some of that here daily. maybe not daily, I'll try to post only one paragrah at the beginning, one paragraph is easy, anybody can do it, right? </p>
        <p>I have been wanting to start blogging daily for a few months now, especially ever since I learnt how to make a simple webpage and put it online. But for some reason, I have been procrastinating on it, I don't know why. why is it be so hard?  (that's what she said. lol ) I mean, it's nothing more typing some shit in a word file and then edit it and hit publish. </p>
        <p>Anyway, no more procrastinating, this is it. no more wasting time watching The Office (hilarious btw). it's time to to start this new habit. </p>
        <p>Uuugh! I hope I'd do it this time and not forget about it for two months again.</p>
        <p>See you tomorrow</p>
