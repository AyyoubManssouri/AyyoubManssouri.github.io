        <div class="Blog__title">Hello, this is my first blog post</div>
        <br><p>well, this is my very first blog ever, actually it's not, I have already written some blog posts before but I deleted them. But now, I'm serious. I will make this a habit, no more procrastinating on publishing my stuff online, who's gonna read it anyway? </p>
<br><p>just me lol.</p>
<br><p>Actually the reason I've finally decided to do this, is a very short article I read today by Seth Godin titled "The most important blog post.". </p>
<br><p>I had a habit of journaling for the past few months, I'll try to post some of that here daily. maybe not daily, I'll try to post only one paragrah at the beginning, one paragraph is easy, anybody can do it, right? </p>
<br><p>I have been wanting to start blogging daily for a few months now, especially ever since I learnt how to make a simple webpage and put it online. But for some reason, I have been procrastinating on it, I don't know why. why is it be so hard?  (that's what she said. lol ) I mean, it's nothing more typing some shit in a word file and then edit it and hit publish. </p>
<br><p>Anyway, no more procrastinating, this is it. no more wasting time watching The Office (hilarious btw). it's time to to start this new habit. </p>
<br><p>Uuugh! I hope I'd do it this time and not forget about it for two months again.</p>
<br><p>See you tomorrow</p>
