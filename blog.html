        <div class="Blog__title">Not much writing</div>
        <p>Hellooo world. Today is the first day in Marsh. which is the month I was born in. My birthday is close, I wonder whether anyone will remember it. I mean anyone besides my parents. They never forget it at all. </p>
        <p>Why do you feel a little bit disappointed when your friends forget about your birthday? why? I don't know why. I mean it's not a very big deal if they do, it's just a date. it's normal if they forget. Anyway, I didn't want to let Facebook remind my friends of it, so I deleted my birthday from it and I won't post it on my WhatsApp stories at all, plus, I'm sure no one from my friends read this website, so it's Okey that I’m talking about it here. </p>
        <p>How was your day? I hope it was great. I had a good day too, woke up early for school. when I came back I spent like 6 hours studying. Not 6 hours straight, obviously, that's impossible. I use the Pomodoro technique, 45min studying, 5min for break.</p>
        <p>What did I learn today? some Sass stuff, some new stuff in php, and I revised some javascript. plus read <a href="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/build_an_audience" target="_blank">this</a> article, and another <a href="https://99u.adobe.com/articles/55974/the-creative-worlds-bullshit-industrial-complex" target="_blank"> one</a>. </p>
        <p>Then watched Real Madrid. Amazing game today, unfortunately, they didn't win, which sucks, but I enjoyed it.</p>
        <p>This is for today, I'm late to writing today, it's already 23.15 so I'm gonna keep it short cause I need to go to sleep. Another rule btw, as soon as I finish my tasks when the sun is down, go to sleep. even If it's 22.00. doesn't matter.</p>
        <p>See you tomorrow.</p>

        <div class="Blog__title">My plan for Substack, boredom...</div>
        <p>So I was just sitting down watching yet another episode of the office. and had a idea, let's spend an hour writing stuff, i don't know what I'm gonna write about, but the point is to spend an entire hour on the computer typing shit.</p>
        <p>Today is Sunday. It's sunny outside. a great weather to go for a walk. I'll probably do that later. I don't know yet. </p>
        <p>This is the fourth day in a row where I publish stuff online. But it's probably the 190th day in a row where I write. Okey, maybe not in a row. I skipped very, very, very few days. Wow, can you believe that? I have been pretty consistent with journaling, I feel good about myself. that's an accomplishment for me. </p>
        <p>Today I found out about Substack, looks like a website like medium. It lets you publish what you write for free. People can subscribe to you and like your posts. I probably wouldn't get likes in 2 years. but whatever, I'll be consistent with it, I treat it like a vlog lol. daily vlgogging, just like Casey Neistat, but in Blogging. </p>
        <p>I also do it because it gives me a sense of small accomplishment, so even If I don't do anything during the day, when I write something and publish it online, it feels like it wasn't a wasted day after all.</p>
        <p>Imagine if I get a job with this, imagine If I start making money?  that is a little bit ambitious and hard, why? cause there are probably thounsands other writers looking for the same thing. but whatever. I'll be consistent with it, and if I even don't make money in two or three years. at least I'll be better at this skill: writing. </p>
        <p>There is nothing to talk about, god my life is so boring currently.</p>
        <p>I guess I'm boring. I don't even know how to initiate a conversation. Yess,  I know you just have to say "HEY". but how can you just do it? it's weird. It's not that I hate people or anything, nope. I enjoy being around people, I just don't wanna feel the pressure to talk and shit. I like to just sit in there and laugh and hope they don't ask me about anything. lol. does that even make any sense? </p>
        <p>What is my plan for substack? Actually I have no plan. I guess I'll just keep writing stuff and publishing it daily for the next few years. I'll probably tell a friend or two about it. share it on twitter even though I only have one follower lol. and then just hope It gets some attention.. I guess.</p>
        <p>"So your plan is to have no plan?"</p>
        <p>Well, I have no plan at all. I think it's a good thing. Because look, when you are trying to start something, and you over-plan or think it, you may end up not doing it at all. It starts to feel like a lot of work. and you don't want that if you are trying to start a habit. Focus on the habit first, then monetize it.</p>
        <p>It feels like I'm giving advice through this journal. am I? </p>
        <p>Well yes and no, yes I'm giving advice, but not to the people reading this, I'm giving it to myself. I use journaling to remind myself of stuff I'm trying to not forget. So if I learn a new thing, I'll probably write about it to rememeber it better. </p>
        <p>Just because I'm saying something doesn't mean I actually live by it or it's part of my life, it may be something I'm trying to add to my life. That means just because I think being responsible in your life is important doesn't mean I'm great at that. Nope, writing about it is a form of reminding myself of it. So if you get the impression of Me-giving-you-advice please, remember that's not the case. </p>
        <p>Oh there is 24 minutes left, I have no idea what the hell I'm gonna write about. You know what, this is it. that's enough lol. I didn't spend exactly an entire hour writing, but I wrote a lot and that's good.</p>
        <p>See you tomorrow.</p>

        <div class="Blog__title">Be patient, it takes time!</div>
        <p>"The day you graduate from childhood to adulthood is the day you take full responsibility for your life." Jim Rohn.</p>
        <p>This quote is soo though-provoking. I stopped reading when I came across it and thought about it for a few seconds. I find it soo true.</p>
        <p>Once you start taking being reponsible in your life, you get a feeling of maturity. What do I mean by being responsable here? It means taking control over your life. not relying on others anymore, or believing that you have to be responsible even though you haven't yet taken contol over your life. </p>
        <p>I'm still relying on my parents for shelter, food and transportation. I don't make money, yet, to have a place, buy food or pay for the bus, but at least I'm aware of it and I'm trying to find a way to do that, it's slow, but there is progress nonetheless. And It feels soo good. it's satisfying to be in control of your life (or trying to). </p>
        <p>Another form of being responsible is stop complaining, realizing that whatever happens to you, you are probably reponsible for it. Got a bad grade? Nope, it's not the professor's fault that the exam was challenging, it's your fault not preparing enough, and it may not even be that hard, just see the A's students, why aren't they complaining?  I just fucking hate it when we are out of an exam and as soon as you open your month, everyone start complaining. It's like, why the hell would your complain? Nobody forces you to go to school, nobody told you not to prepare for it. Don't blame being a lazy fuck on others. And no, I'm not a great student either, I just hate complaining. (the irony here, i'm complaining).</p>
        <p>“Don’t wish it were easier; wish you were better.”</p>
        <p>Of course, there are exceptions to that. you are not responsible for your grandma having cancer. There is nothing you can about it but just accept it. </p>
        <p>You can be responsible in other mundane ways. Like doing stuf that usually your parents do for you. Like, washing the dishes from time to time, or washing your fucking underwear. Or doing some paper work at some place, don't let your daddy do it for you, go out and do it for youself. and if you are a parent, teach your kidz this early on, I believe it's a good thing.</p>
        <p>As all things, it takes time. You can't just have complete control over every aspect of your life over-night. It, obviously, takes years of financial struggle to achieve financial freedom. It takes years of practice to become self-aware and not an emotional vampire. It takes years to find out who you really are, no matter what the fuck that means. </p>
        <p>So be patient. don't complain. it's hard. it's boring. it takes time. but it'll be worth it.</p>
        <p>See you tomorrow.</p>

        <div class="Blog__title">Not Good Enough</div>
        <p>Alright, yess I'm a little bit late today. I didn't do anything useful for my life today, I basically wasted it all watchig 10 episodes of The Office. I'll try to write a lot today to compensate for for it the feelings of guilt of not doing anything useful.<p>
        <p>Write about what? I don't know. it doesn't matter. what matters is that now, I'm sitting at my computer typing shit on the keyboard, <a href="https://markmanson.net/how-to-get-motivated" target="_blank">actions</a> comes first, then thoughts follow.<p>
        <p>Today was a good day after all, one of my favourite rappers dropped an EP which I enjoyed. I have many ideas for this website, first of all, when I have enough money, I'll buy a domain name, to get rid of that github.io in the URL. How will I make money? I don't know. I'll try something. </p>
        <p>The Office is a really good show to watch. But it's not my favourite. It's the Walking Dead, that's my all-time favourite show. why, you must be asking? Well, there isn't really a good reason, I just grew up watching it. I've started watching it when it first started. I remember a friend in the in the neighbourhood told me about it, ever since then I became a fan. It probably was 2012 or 2011, I'm not sure, it's a long time ago. that's why I love the show, even if I watch a bad episode or season, you wouldn't hear me complaining about it. why? because I don't care, as long as the show is on, I'm good. unfortunately, it will end by next year. season 11 is the last season.</p>
        <p>I'm also a very big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF" target="_blank"> Real Madrid</a> fan. huge fan. One day, when I have enough money to fly places, I'll attend most games, especially UCL games. Wish me luck.</p>
        <p>I think of of the reasons I've been procrastinating starting daily blogging is the fear of making something not good enough. but you know what? Every one was once a beginner at the thing they're good at currently, no matter what that thing is. But, we get to only see the end result, so we think that that person somehow magically is good at that.</p>
        <p>This fear is irrational. it just stops you from doing the thing that will actually make you better at what you're doing: practice. I know what I'm writing is not good enough, not useful and uninteresting. But it is what it is. I'm still not good enough, it's completely normal.</p>
        <p>I'm just starting out. but there is hope. if you repeat it, actually stick to it, and try to get better at it, You'll eventually get better. yeah, you may not write a best-seller, but there will be progress. Actually, fuck that. I'm not doing it to get rich of make money off of it. it'd be stupid to think that. I'm doing it cause why not? it's easy to publish stuff online, I like english, so let's write stuff and put it online.</p>
        <p>Oh I write a lot today as well. hell yeah. maybe it wasn't an unproductive day after all. </p>
        <p>See you tomorrow.</p>

        <div class="Blog__title">Why I hate social media</div>
        <p>Hello, yes, this is the second day of daily blogging, glad I made it this far lol. </p>
        <p>I just go back from school and figured I better write now before I start wasting my time doing useless shit like watching youtube.</p>
        <p>There is one thing that always happen when I sit down and want to write something, and that is when I try to think of something to talk about, suddenly nothing comes to mind, but when I just start typing random stuff, next thing I know is I've written 500 words down.</p>
        <p>I love <a href="https://markmanson.net/how-to-get-better" target="_blank">writing</a>, just as much as I love reading. okey, I like reading more, I'd say reading is the best habit I ever had, I'll forever be glad that I started reading at a young age (18, maybe not so young). But, nowadays, with social media and a million youtube video to watch, reading doesn't seem so appealing, cause it takes time. and I don't think many people read, just pick a book and sit somewhere in your school and see how people will look at you, your friends will probably joke about it and make fun of you for having a book or  even thinking about buying one. Meanwhile, if you are taking pics of food at a restaurant and posting that on IG, that's normal. Oh yeah, fuck those people who do this.</p>
        <p>Why the hell would you take a pic of your food and post it online? "Oh look at me I have money to go to a restaurant". suppose I'm on phone swiping between stories and I see your food pic, what value did that add to my life? <strong>NOTHING.</strong> </p>
        <p>Speaking of <a href="https://markmanson.net/attention-diet" target="_blank">social media</a>. I hate watching vlogs. I think it's a waste of time. (PS. I do watch some also.). why? because I believe that if you have the time to watch other people living their lives, you  really need to re-consider your life decisions. you probably have a shitty life.</p>
        <p>It just doesn't make any sense. If you had an interesting life, you wouldn't have time to watch other people living theirs. </p>
        <p>One of the reasons I love writing is it feels like you're having a conversation with yourself. and I like to give myself advice, remind myself of stuff, or simply just think about stuff through journaling.</p>
        <p>I've written a lot. that's enough for today, it doesn't matter what I wrote, I will eventually get better at it, and then I'll write big essays about useful stuff, now I just write about whatever in my mind, just to keep the habit going, to get better at least <a href="https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement" target="_blank">1% a day</a>.</p>
        <p>See you tomorrow.</p>

        <div class="Blog__title">Hello, this is my first blog post</div>
        <p>well, this is my very first blog ever, actually it's not, I have already written some blog posts before but I deleted them. But now, I'm serious. I will make this a habit, no more procrastinating on publishing my stuff online, who's gonna read it anyway? </p>
        <p>just me lol.</p>
        <p>Actually the reason I've finally decided to do this, is a very short article I read today by Seth Godin titled "<a href="https://seths.blog/2020/12/the-most-important-blog-post/" target="_blank" >The most important blog post.</a>". </p>
        <p>I had a habit of journaling for the past few months, I'll try to post some of that here daily. maybe not daily, I'll try to post only one paragrah at the beginning, one paragraph is easy, anybody can do it, right? </p>
        <p>I have been wanting to start blogging daily for a few months now, especially ever since I learnt how to make a simple webpage and put it online. But for some reason, I have been procrastinating on it, I don't know why. why is it be so hard?  (that's what she said. lol ) I mean, it's nothing more typing some shit in a word file and then edit it and hit publish. </p>
        <p>Anyway, no more procrastinating, this is it. no more wasting time watching The Office (hilarious btw). it's time to to start this new habit. </p>
        <p>Uuugh! I hope I'd do it this time and not forget about it for two months again.</p>
        <p>See you tomorrow</p>
