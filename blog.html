        <div class="Blog__title">Not Good Enough</div>
        <p>Alright, yess I'm a little bit late today. I didn't do anything useful for my life today, I basically wasted it all watchig 10 episodes of The Office. I'll try to write a lot today to compensate for for it the feelings of guilt of not doing anything useful.<p>
        <p>Write about what? I don't know. it doesn't matter. what matters is that now, I'm sitting at my computer typing shit on the keyboard, <a href="https://markmanson.net/how-to-get-motivated" target="_blank">actions</a> comes first, then thoughts follow.<p>
        <p>Today was a good day after all, one of my favourite rappers dropped an EP which I enjoyed. I have many ideas for this website, first of all, when I have enough money, I'll buy a domain name, to get rid of that github.io in the URL. How will I make money? I don't know. I'll try something. </p>
        <p>The Office is a really good show to watch. But it's not my favourite. It's the Walking Dead, that's my all-time favourite show. why, you must be asking? Well, there isn't really a good reason, I just grew up watching it. I've started watching it when it first started. I remember a friend in the in the neighbourhood told me about it, ever since then I became a fan. It probably was 2012 or 2011, I'm not sure, it's a long time ago. that's why I love the show, even if I watch a bad episode or season, you wouldn't hear me complaining about it. why? because I don't care, as long as the show is on, I'm good. unfortunately, it will end by next year. season 11 is the last season.</p>
        <p>I'm also a very big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF" target="_blank"> Real Madrid</a> fan. huge fan. One day, when I have enough money to fly places, I'll attend most games, especially UCL games. Wish me luck.</p>
        <p>I think of of the reasons I've been procrastinating starting daily blogging is the fear of making something not good enough. but you know what? Every one was once a beginner at the thing they're good at currently, no matter what that thing is. But, we get to only see the end result, so we think that that person somehow magically is good at that.</p>
        <p>This fear is irrational. it just stops you from doing the thing that will actually make you better at what you're doing: practice. I know what I'm writing is not good enough, not useful and uninteresting. But it is what it is. I'm still not good enough, it's completely normal.</p>
        <p>I'm just starting out. but there is hope. if you repeat it, actually stick to it, and try to get better at it, You'll eventually get better. yeah, you may not write a best-seller, but there will be progress. Actually, fuck that. I'm not doing it to get rich of make money off of it. it'd be stupid to think that. I'm doing it cause why not? it's easy to publish stuff online, I like english, so let's write stuff and put it online.</p>
        <p>Oh I write a lot today as well. hell yeah. maybe it wasn't an unproductive day after all. </p>
        <p>See you tomorrow.</p>

        <div class="Blog__title">Why I hate social media</div>
        <p>Hello, yes, this is the second day of daily blogging, glad I made it this far lol. </p>
        <p>I just go back from school and figured I better write now before I start wasting my time doing useless shit like watching youtube.</p>
        <p>There is one thing that always happen when I sit down and want to write something, and that is when I try to think of something to talk about, suddenly nothing comes to mind, but when I just start typing random stuff, next thing I know is I've written 500 words down.</p>
        <p>I love <a href="https://markmanson.net/how-to-get-better" target="_blank">writing</a>, just as much as I love reading. okey, I like reading more, I'd say reading is the best habit I ever had, I'll forever be glad that I started reading at a young age (18, maybe not so young). But, nowadays, with social media and a million youtube video to watch, reading doesn't seem so appealing, cause it takes time. and I don't think many people read, just pick a book and sit somewhere in your school and see how people will look at you, your friends will probably joke about it and make fun of you for having a book or  even thinking about buying one. Meanwhile, if you are taking pics of food at a restaurant and posting that on IG, that's normal. Oh yeah, fuck those people who do this.</p>
        <p>Why the hell would you take a pic of your food and post it online? "Oh look at me I have money to go to a restaurant". suppose I'm on phone swiping between stories and I see your food pic, what value did that add to my life? <strong>NOTHING.</strong> </p>
        <p>Speaking of <a href="https://markmanson.net/attention-diet" target="_blank">social media</a>. I hate watching vlogs. I think it's a waste of time. (PS. I do watch some also.). why? because I believe that if you have the time to watch other people living their lives, you  really need to re-consider your life decisions. you probably have a shitty life.</p>
        <p>It just doesn't make any sense. If you had an interesting life, you wouldn't have time to watch other people living theirs. </p>
        <p>One of the reasons I love writing is it feels like you're having a conversation with yourself. and I like to give myself advice, remind myself of stuff, or simply just think about stuff through journaling.</p>
        <p>I've written a lot. that's enough for today, it doesn't matter what I wrote, I will eventually get better at it, and then I'll write big essays about useful stuff, now I just write about whatever in my mind, just to keep the habit going, to get better at least <a href="https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement" target="_blank">1% a day</a>.</p>
        <p>See you tomorrow.</p>

        <div class="Blog__title">Hello, this is my first blog post</div>
        <p>well, this is my very first blog ever, actually it's not, I have already written some blog posts before but I deleted them. But now, I'm serious. I will make this a habit, no more procrastinating on publishing my stuff online, who's gonna read it anyway? </p>
        <p>just me lol.</p>
        <p>Actually the reason I've finally decided to do this, is a very short article I read today by Seth Godin titled "<a href="https://seths.blog/2020/12/the-most-important-blog-post/" target="_blank" >The most important blog post.</a>". </p>
        <p>I had a habit of journaling for the past few months, I'll try to post some of that here daily. maybe not daily, I'll try to post only one paragrah at the beginning, one paragraph is easy, anybody can do it, right? </p>
        <p>I have been wanting to start blogging daily for a few months now, especially ever since I learnt how to make a simple webpage and put it online. But for some reason, I have been procrastinating on it, I don't know why. why is it be so hard?  (that's what she said. lol ) I mean, it's nothing more typing some shit in a word file and then edit it and hit publish. </p>
        <p>Anyway, no more procrastinating, this is it. no more wasting time watching The Office (hilarious btw). it's time to to start this new habit. </p>
        <p>Uuugh! I hope I'd do it this time and not forget about it for two months again.</p>
        <p>See you tomorrow</p>
