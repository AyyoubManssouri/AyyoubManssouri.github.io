    <h1>Some awful shit humans do</h1>
        <p> <span id="Hoho">I</span>t's moorning. and I'm going to take a shower in an hour or something. and it's very early. so what? let's write a little. yesterday was nice. but the real madrid game tied again. fuck shit. but it's cool. it was a really good game. I enjoyed it too much btw.</p>
        <p>Actually I don't have anything specific in mind to talk about so let's just read an <a href="https://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/" target="_blank">article</a> and talk about it.</p>
        <p>Here is an interesting question for you? how much of your everyday actions do you think are influanced by signaling to others? school or college, do you really go to that place in order to gain knowledge that's likely to make you more valuable in the real world? is that really the reason you are going to college? I feel like most people are not. simply because not everyone does good in college. most people are procrastinators. we wait untill the day before the exam then we read the material hoping that we pass the exam, and then forget everything by next week. do you remember all the stuff you studied the last year of high-school? probably not. I know I don't.
        <p>
        <br>
        fuck.
        <br>
        <p>you may be totally aware of that, to the point that you really wanna drop out. but you are afraid to disappoint your parents. After all, they still think that college in the only way to succeed in life. Maybe they're right, maybe not. or you are afraid to look like an ignorant piece of shit in front of your peers. because, we subconciously believe that if a friend went to a popular school, then they are somehow better. don't believe me? just notice how your behaviour change when you know that somebody was accepted to harvard or when someone mentionned they went to to some prestigious school. I noticed that about myself, and It sucks. like, just because you went to some very popular and respected school doesn't make you a better person or a more moral person, then why our actions are influanced by that? 
        <p>
        <p>we have <a href="https://markmanson.net/cognitive-biases-that-make-us-terrible" target="_blank">shitty</a> minds.</p>
        <p>What about the pics/stories you post on social media? how much of that is just signaling? why do some people take a screenshot of how many hours they talked on the phone and then share it on stories? nobody gives a fuck about that. <strong>NOBODY</strong>. yet, many still do it. 
        </p>
        <p>maybe this is just another form of signaling: "hey look, I have a person that I can talk to for hours, you see, I'm a loved and accepted person. also,i'm a little insecure about myself, therefore I need to the 100 followers I have that I have people who love (or people who have nothing to do in their lives besides talking for 3hours on the phone lol)".</p> <br>
        or those who share pics of their food? yeah, fuck those people too.
        <p>And look, i'm no better than other people. I'd do some of this shit too. and while I hate to admit it, but it's true. we are selfish. we all wanna be percieved as high-status, loved, belong to a group..the problem is that when it becomes your natural state. when you all you care about is how others think of you. and while it's impossible to just not give a fuck what others think, you can still choose to prioritize what you think of yourself more than what others think of you. how does that look in real life? saying a joke even if you think others won't find funny. Do something even if others will find it dumb. ask that question in class even if you think everyone will think it's a stupid question. </p>
