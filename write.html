        <h1>the reason I started writing.</h1>
<p>I am a big believer in the fact that if you are over 18 years old, then you should get the fuck out and try to get a job to pay for your basic utilities. And I think that every parents should tell their kids this when they are 18. the problem is I live in a society where it's Okey to be over 18 and still live with your parents. you're not gonna be embarassed if you are 25 and still living in your dad's house and eating your dad's food. that's normal. and I fucking hate that. </p>
<p>telling your kids to go out and try to make something out of themselves isn't  really a bad thig.I wonder why tf parents are not saying that to their kids. they'd say that they love too much and wouldn't like it that their kid is working for somebody. in the words of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWbj-2DRLps" target="_blank" class="a"> dr.Jordan peterson </a>:" ..<em>If you are too compassionate toward your kids then you do everything, and if you do everything for them then they grow up useless and they never leave and they hate you..</em>".
</p>
<p>Obviously, I don't hate my dad, but the fact he never insisted that I take control of my own life and try to rely on myself more than I rely on him.</p>
<p>well, my dad is too nice to us (his children). he always tells me that he's willing to keep working untill we stand on our feet (get a "real job" I mean). but I wish my dad told me a year ago when I turned 18 is :"<strong>LISTEN KID, YOU ARE NOT A KID ANYMORE, YOU ARE OFFICIALLY A MAN, SO GET OUT THERE AND START TAKING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE, I WON'T BE AROUND FOREVER, YOU CAN'T KEEP RELYING ON ME FOR EVERYTHING ( FOOD, TRANSPORTATION, PLACE TO LIVE). I KNOW IT'S TOUGH TO PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE. BUT IT'S WORTH IT.</strong>"</p>
<p>The problem is I'm a shy person, going outside and asking people for a job isn't easy. I always try to do that, but I just end up wandering around and then come back home pissed off at why I didn't do anything. So what should I do?
</p>
<p>Hopefully, there is this thing called the internet. and I'm good at english, and I love writing. aaaand there are a lot of people who read. so why not start a website and share my writings? </p>
<p>Who the hell knows? maybe this would turn into a profitable business one day. maybe I find a job doing this. maybe, I can create an audience. I DON'T KNOW. But it's still worth trying anyway, it gives me a feeling of actually doing something, of being productive. this may be my first step into creating something out of myself. and If you feel the same, then I encourage you to do the same. start writing, you won't regret it.
