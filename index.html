        <h1>Hey.</h1>
       <p>my name is Ayyoub Manssouri, I'm 19 years old. and I love to write stuff down. </p>
<p>Actually, let's go back a few months ago, I was reading <a href="https://markmanson.net/goals" class="a"> this </a>article by Mark Manson (my favourite blogger btw), in which he mentionned the habit of writing. so, ever since then, I've been trying to develop the habit of writing. As with any new habit, it's hard to be consistent. So I emailed him asking how can I make writing a daily habit. and the answer was pretty simple lol, he basically responded with: "By writing everyday".</p>
<p>So that's what I did...<br>
...and ended up making this website. </p>
<p>By writing, I don't mean writing whole articles or essays everyday. I write about stupid everyday stuff sometimes, and sometimes I write down my ideas and thoughts...anything to keep the habit going. on this website, I'll try to share some of it.<p>
<p>sometimes, I write something and then wish I had a platfrom where I can share it with the world to read, to see if there is someone who can relate. to let readers point out to stuff I'm wrong about. and also, to get more <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ayyoubmanssouri01/?hl=fr" target="_blank" class="a"> IG </a>followers lol. </p>
<p>No, for real now. I don't know what I'm doing (who does anyway?). starting a personal website to share my thoughts and ideas with people isn't a bad thing. writing is a good habit. So why not? </p>
<p> I have to mention that I'm not a native english-speaker and I'm not that great at all at writing. I'm a complete beginner, so excuse my grammar mistakes.</p>
<p> Come say <a href="Contact.html" class="a">Hi</a> if you want to.</p>
