    <h1>Fisrt upload! Honestly I didn't know what to title this lol.</h1>
    <p>actually, this will be the first shit I put online. so I don't really care how it looks or anything, I just need to put it online.</p>
<p>See, the trick to buildig habits is to start stupidly small that you can't say no. Wanna start a habit of reading, read 10 mintues a day, soon you'll fall in love with reading and find yourself reading 1 hour a day. wanna start meditating daily? simply start with 5 minute, sit down and do nothing for 5 minutes. anybody can do that. it's impossible to procrastinate.</p>
<p>I wanted to start putting stuff I wrote online. actually, I have a goal of writing 20 articles this year. but as I learnt from this article, building habits is probably better than setting goals. saying I'll write daily one paragraph/day and put it online is a lot better than having a goal of writing 20 articles this year.</p>
<p>why? because If I only tell yself I'll wite just one paragraph, the it becomes impossible to not do it. one paragraph! what. that's easy. and If I can keep it up for at least a month. I'll end up with a lot more than just 20 aticles this year.</p>
<p>So yeah, this is the first one. I know it's full of mistakes, not perfect and definitely written poorly. but whatever, what matters is I started. </p>
<p>see ya tomorrow.</p>
